# Markow text generator
It is a Python implementation of a Markov Text Generator.

A [Markov Text Generator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain) can be used to randomly generate
realistic sentences, using words from a corpus of texts. Words are joined together in sequence, with each new word 
being selected based on how often it follows the previous word in the corpus.
